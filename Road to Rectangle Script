Road to Rectangle Script

Hello fellow GCC haters!

This video is gonna be a little different from previous uploads since I was sick with the flu during most of these streams and didn't have much of a voice, so I'll do a little voice over today while you watch me try to remember which button does what.

Unlike my first attempt at learning to use a rectangle, I've completely abandoned the Gamecube controller. Forcing myself to fully commit to a new controller intstead of trying to do this weird dance of still using my gcc to compete, but practicing tech on a rectangle.
